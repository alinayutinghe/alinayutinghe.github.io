        <h1>Sydney Premiere of Project Q: War, Peace and Quantum Mechanics</h1>

        <p>
            On Wednesday, 29 October 2025 the Centre for International Security Studies (CISS) screened its documentary film, Project Q: War, Peace and Quantum Mechanics, at the University of Sydney’s Footbridge Theatre.  Following the premiere at the Melbourne Documentary Film Festival, the evening brought together researchers across various disciplines, students, and members of the public for a thought-provoking exploration of quantum theory, technologies and global politics. This special event was presented as part of the 2025 UN International Year of Quantum Science and Technology, in collaboration with the Sydney Nano Institute and the Australian Institute of Physics.

            Directed and written by Professor James Der Derian, Project Q takes audiences on a journey through time and across borders to explore the ethical and geopolitical implications of the quantum revolution. Amid the global race for quantum dominance among universities, tech giants, and major powers, the documentary asks what is at stake for the future of global conflict and cooperation.         </p>
        <p>Following the screening, a dynamic discussion between Professor Der Derian and the audience was moderated by CISS Visiting Fellow Stan Grant. New breakthroughs in quantum technology as well as new ways of quantum thinking were raised. Professor Der Derian noted that as the world transits toward a new stage of global politics informed by the emergence of a quantum paradigm, we find ourselves confronting profound uncertainties and ambiguities — a ‘polycrisis’ moment of in-betweenness in human history. Heading towards a quantum future, as he suggested, these are questions not only for physical and social scientists, but for thinkers and policymakers across all fields of knowledge.
</p>
        <p>
Stan Grant responded in-depth to the question of how quantum thinking resonates with indigenous cosmologies, which are significantly different from the Western Newtonian–Cartesian conceptions of space and time. He reflected that the study of quantum theory may contribute not only to the studies of the encounters between First Nations peoples and British colonisers in Australia, but to a more critical understanding of traditional concepts of sovereignty and borders, war and peace. Engaging discussions at the intersection of science, philosophy, history and global politics offered audiences new perspectives on the challenges and possibilities of a quantum future.

The CISS Director ended the evening by thanking Project Q team and the funders for the documentary, including the Carnegie Corporation of New York, Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and Sydney Quantum Academy.
